Magic square finder
===================

This is a JavaScript implementation of a brute-force algorithm to find [magic squares][w].

Why? Because I wanted to see how difficult it would be. And it was a nice project that only one hour to get some results, plus a couple of hours to experiment with it and polish it a little bit.
